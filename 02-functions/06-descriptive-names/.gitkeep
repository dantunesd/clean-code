Note that all method names is descriptive.

It literally says what it does.

It follows the same pattern for common things like: 

* If a method verifies if something has something else and returns a boolean, its name starts with "has". Like "hasValidStart", "hasValidRange", etc.

* If a method verifies if something is something else and returns a boolean, its name starts with "is". Like "IsValidIp", "isAnOctet", etc.

Try to apply naming conventions as we have previosuly seen.
